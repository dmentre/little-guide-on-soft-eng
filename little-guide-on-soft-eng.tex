The purpose of this guide is to give in a concise manner the essential
rules of good Software Engineering.

\begin{description}
\item[\Rule{} Use meaningful names]

 Names of variables, procedures, methods, packages, ... should let the
 reader understand the purpose of the entity without having to look at
 its context, internals, etc.

\item[\Rule{} Test or prove thoroughly your code]

\item[\Rule{} Be DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself]

\item[\Rule{} Cut program into orthogonal modules with loose dependency
  between them]

\item[\Rule{} Document the why in code (internals) and the how of
  interface (externals)]

\item[\Rule{} Automate everything]

\item[\Rule{} Use contracts and assertions]

\item[\Rule{} Use minimal dependencies but don't reinvent the wheel]

\item[\Rule{} Specify and use iterative development cycle]

\item[\Rule{} Use a version control system and do Continuous
  Integration]
