Little guide on Software Engineering
====================================

The purpose of this guide is to give in a concise manner the essential
rules of good Software Engineering.

1. Use meaningful names

 Names of variables, procedures, methods, packages, ... should let the
 reader understand the purpose of the entity without having to look at
 its context, internals, etc.

2. Test or prove thoroughly your code

3. Be DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

4. Cut program into orthogonal modules with loose dependency between
   them

5. Document the why in code (internals) and the how of interface
   (externals)

6. Automate everything

7. Use contracts and assertions

8. Use minimal dependencies but don't reinvent the wheel

9. Specify and use iterative development cycle

10. Use a version control system and do Continuous Integration
